# Topic Modeling
Topic modeling is a type of algorithm that scans a set of documents (known in the NLP field as a corpus), examines how words and phrases co-occur in them, and automatically “learns” groups or clusters of words that best characterize those documents.(Patrick van Kessel, 2018) These sets of words often appear to represent a coherent theme or topic.

In my final project for course of LING 6300 Machine Learning & Linguistics, I will use two unsupervised learning models: K-Means and Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA) to do topic modeling on a user reviews dataset.
